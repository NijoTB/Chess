Rules:
Chess is a classic two-player strategy game played on an 8x8 grid board. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective of the game is to checkmate your opponent's king, which means putting the king in a position where it is under attack and cannot escape capture.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to play chess:

Setup: Place the board between the players so that each player has a white square on their right-hand side. Arrange the pieces on the board as follows:

Each player places their pieces on the two rows closest to them.
The rooks are placed in the corners.
The knights are placed next to the rooks.
The bishops are placed next to the knights.
The queen is placed on the remaining square of her color (white queen on a white square, black queen on a black square).
The king is placed on the remaining square next to the queen.
The eight pawns are placed on the second row in front of the other pieces.
Turns: Players take turns to make moves. White always starts the game.

Moving Pieces: Each type of piece moves in a different way.

King: Can move one square in any direction.
Queen: Can move any number of squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.
Rook: Can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
Bishop: Can move any number of squares diagonally.
Knight: Moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular to that.
Pawn: Can move forward one square (or two squares on its first move), but captures diagonally.
Capturing: If a piece lands on a square occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is removed from the board and considered captured.

Check and Checkmate:

If a player's king is under attack by one or more of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check.
If a player's king is in check and there is no legal move that the player can make to remove the threat, it is checkmate, and the game ends with that player losing.
Stalemate: If a player's king is not in check but the player has no legal moves to make, it is stalemate, and the game ends in a draw.

End of Game: The game ends when one player achieves checkmate.
